This data science project involves reading data from an SQLite database, dealing with missing values, analyzing the relationship between online orders and restaurant ratings, performing text analysis using tokenization, removing stopwords, and analyzing unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams. It also includes extracting geographical coordinates from the data, building geographical heatmaps, and automating the analysis for different cuisines such as North Indian, South Indian, and Chinese.
